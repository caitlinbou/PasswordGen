#Password Generation Project

In this project I worked with alerts and confirms inside of a function to identify what password criteria the user wished to use for a randomly generated secure password (within a certain parameter for the length of the password), and to use that information to generate said password.

After creating an array of the user's character type selections, I used the Math.random function to pull out random index numbers with values matching the user selections, and concatenated the associated values into a string of the user-selected length to display for the user. 

I have attached screen shots to show the functionality.
